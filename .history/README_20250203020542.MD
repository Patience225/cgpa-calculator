# CGPA Calculator

A web-based CGPA Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to help university students (with a focus on UNN grading system) compute their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) by entering course details, credit hours, and grades. The application also features an adjustable grade-to-point mapping to cater to any departmental or policy variations.

## Overview

The CGPA Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for students to calculate their cumulative GPA. The project implements the UNN grading system by default, which is as follows:

- **A (70–100%)**: 5.0 grade points  
- **B (60–69%)**: 4.0 grade points  
- **C (50–59%)**: 3.0 grade points  
- **D (45–49%)**: 2.0 grade points  
- **E (40–44%)**: 1.0 grade point  
- **F (0–39%)**: 0.0 grade points  

The calculator multiplies the grade point of each course by its credit hours, sums them up, and then divides by the total credit hours to yield the CGPA.

## Features

- **Adjustable Grade Mapping:** Update grade-to-point values in real time to match any changes or departmental variations.
- **Real-Time CGPA Calculation:** Calculates and displays the CGPA upon submission.
- **Course Summary Display:** Lists each course with its details and calculated grade points.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores entered data in `localStorage` for easy retrieval upon revisiting.
