## Overview

The CGPA Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for students to calculate their cumulative GPA. The project implements the UNN grading system by default, which is as follows:

- **A (70–100%)**: 5.0 grade points  
- **B (60–69%)**: 4.0 grade points  
- **C (50–59%)**: 3.0 grade points  
- **D (45–49%)**: 2.0 grade points  
- **E (40–44%)**: 1.0 grade point  
- **F (0–39%)**: 0.0 grade points  

The calculator multiplies the grade point of each course by its credit hours, sums them up, and then divides by the total credit hours to yield the CGPA.
